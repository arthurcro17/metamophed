THINGS TO IMPROVE: 

Description:
    For creating new description, BigCommerce formats the descriptions with HTML tags, and chatgpt sometimes removes those tags if not specifically told to keep them. 
    For displaying the descriptions, would like to have the descriptions formatted according to the html tags, but am having issue with react-html-parser, and don't want to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML

Variants:
    Began adding the feature to include product variants, but don't think the functionality is needed. May go back and include feature.
